As the year comes to an end take a pause to reflect & set goals

The start of the New Year is when many of set our goals for the upcoming year. However, often we do this without reflecting on what we accomplished and where we failed during the year that's ending.

Complete these important steps prior to setting new goals:

1. Did you meet the goals you set for the current year?

2. What struggles did you have during the current year and what did you do to get around them?

3. What failures did you have and did you work to learn from them?

4. What were your successes and what did you learn from them?

5. Think back to where you were at this time last year and compare it to where you are this year. Are you satisfied with your progress? Be honest with your self appraisal, but not overly critical!

To help with this its a good idea to make a list! It's more important for it to be focused and actionable.

For your new goals make them SMART. Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Time-based.

Let us know some of the accomplishments, failures you learned from or goals you will set for the new year as we can all learn from each other.

Hoping everyone has a happy, healthy and prosperous 2020 ðŸ¥‚ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ
