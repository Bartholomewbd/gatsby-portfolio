Welcome to my blog and portfolio.  I am Brian Bartholomew a full-stack developer in Connecticut.   I also am a part time teaching assistant and remote mentor for the trilogy bootcamps.  

This has been an item on my list for a very long time so I figured what better time then in the new year to get started.  As we ring in 2020 I have a number of things I want to learn and improve on and my first goal is almost complete in setting up this updated portfolio with a blog.  It will provide me an outlet to improve my writing, share the new things that I am learning on a constant basis and a good source to reflect on the things I have done and how I have improved. 

I really look forward to what the new year has to bring and sharing all my accomplishments and yes failures as well in a way to get better all around.
