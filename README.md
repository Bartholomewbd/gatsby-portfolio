# My Portfolio and Blog

With the start of 2020 I felt the need to update my portfolio and add a blog. The original project repository can be found here in Github it was a static html scss and javascript site.  I have fully moved over to GatsbyJS.  The site is utilizing Netlify for hosting and Netlify CMS for uploading media.  I also want to get it to pull data from other sources such as dev.to.

The site can be found at [Portfolio](https://brianbartholomew.tech)
